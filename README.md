# terraform

Increasing understanding of Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) by building AWS infrastructure using .tf files exclusively.

Head to directories & run `terraform plan` to understand what changes will be introduced & then `terraform apply` if happy.

This will spin up MySQL DB instances, ELB load balancers & EC2 instances in `us-east-1`.

Note that you will need AWS credentials in your `~/.zshrc` or wherever you store environment variables.
